> ## ABANDONED
>
> As of the 2.3.0 release, I have marked this module as abandoned.
>
> The module very quickly proved that the approach was worthwhile and useful,
> and became the seed for [Apigility](https://apigility.org/). That project has
> far surpassed its origins in this module, and added a ton of functionality
> this module never managed to create, such as content negotiation, file upload
> handling, entity and collection hydration, and more.
>
> As such, I recommend using Apigility in favor of PhlyRestfully for new
> projects, and that existing projects migrate to Apigility when possible.

This module provides structure and code for quickly implementing RESTful APIs
that use JSON as a transport.

It allows you to create RESTful JSON APIs that use the following standards:

-   [HAL](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-03), used for creating
    hypermedia links
-   [Problem API](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-02),
    used for reporting API problems

[Documentation is available at rtfd.org](https://phlyrestfully.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

# Upgrading

If you were using version 1.0.0 or earlier (the version presented at PHP
Benelux 2013), you will need to make some changes to your application to get it
to work.

-   First, the terminology has changed, as have some class names, to reference
    "resources" instead of "items"; this is more in line with RESTful terminology.
    -   As such, if you had any code using `PhlyRestfully\HalItem`, it should now
        reference `PhlyRestfully\HalResource`. Similarly, in that class, you will
        access the actual resource object now from the `resource` property
        instead of the `item` property. (This should only affect those post-1.0.0).
    -   If you want to create link for an individual resource, use the
        `forResource` method of `HalLinks`, and not the `forItem` method.
    -   `InvalidItemException` was renamed to `InvalidResourceException`.
-   A number of items were moved from the `RestfulJsonModel` to the
    `RestfulJsonRenderer`.
    -   Hydrators
    -   The flag for displaying exception backtraces; in fact, you can use
        the `view_manager.display_exceptions` configuration setting to set
        this behavior.
-   All results from the `ResourceController` are now pushed to a `payload`
    variable in the view model.
    -   Additionally, `ApiProblem`, `HalResource`, and `HalCollection` are
        first-class objects, and are used as the `payload` values.
-   The `Links` plugin was renamed to `HalLinks`, and is now also available as
    a view helper.
